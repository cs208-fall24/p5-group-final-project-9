## Experience

This final project was a fun one to work through. It was fun to be able to apply everything that I've learned in this course into one project. I particularly enjoy the back-end server code the most I find that to be the most engaging part of the project and was the most fun to work through. It is the part that I struggled the most with because it was just more complex than the other parts of the project but with some tinkering and debugging, I was eventually able to work through it and figure out a working build. 

I was able to get all the HTML and CSS working to a state that I was happy with I always enjoy making ugly websites so I tried to channel the year 1999. One thing that stood out to me in this project was that I have started to solidify my understanding of NODE  working with it and and how it's structured was an interesting hurdle to get through this entire semester but I feel like I've got it down at this point which was gratifying to finally accomplish. 

Overall I enjoyed my time with this project it was pretty straightforward reading through the readme and was able to kind of work through it at a steady pace and was pleased with my progress each time I sat down to work with it. This project has solidified my understanding of how back and front ends connect and interact in web development so I feel that this was a very fulfilling project to end the course with for me.
