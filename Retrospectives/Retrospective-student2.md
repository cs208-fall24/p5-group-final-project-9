## Experience
This project was both fun and stressful, pushing me in ways I hadn’t anticipated. The branching and merging on github was incredibly stressful. I have taken CS121 and CS155 both teaching and requiring github, but I don't think it showed with my performance of the github management in this project. I dont know why but I struggled with ensuring I was on my branch in VSCode, it felt like it defaulted to the master branch. My initial commits went to the master and I tried undoing the commit to resubmit it onto my branch but that turned into a mess. After meeting with Shoaib I had the correct merging down. Coming into this without any previous experience in web development, I found myself struggling through almost every project. Despite the challenges, I am deeply grateful to my group member, Chandler, whose guidance and support were crucial in getting my code to function properly. I have a love-hate relationship with full-stack development. On  one hand, I love seeing the final product come to life in the browser, a tangible result of effort and creativity. The incredible possibilities within this field are inspiring, offering countless ways to customize and improve a project. On the other hand, those same possibilities can feel overwhelming. Full-stack development demands mastery of so many different aspects various programming languages, numerous packages, and add-ons, not to mention understanding backend and frontend interactions with database management as the cherry on top. Throughout this class, I’ve gained a much greater appreciation for the complexity and potential of full-stack development. It’s been a humbling yet rewarding experience, teaching me not only technical skills but also patience and perseverance. However, I’ve realized that this might not be the path I want to pursue professionally. While I am proud of the progress I’ve made and grateful for the lessons learned, I don’t see myself specializing in full-stack development anytime soon.

## Known issues or Bugs
There are no known issues anymore, but I did struggle with getting my comment edit page to apply my CSS. Initially, I encountered an error stating that the edit page was refusing to apply the stylesheet because its MIME type ('text/html') was not a supported stylesheet. After some back and forth troubleshooting with the browser, I confirmed that there was nothing wrong with the link to the CSS file itself. Interestingly, there were no differences between this page and my other two pages where the CSS worked perfectly. Ultimately, after ensuring the <!DOCTYPE html> declaration was included and carefully reviewing my margins and spacing, the edit page finally began to recognize and apply the CSS properly.
